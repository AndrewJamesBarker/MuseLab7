# MuseLab7
mvp of music collab app
The Begeinning of an idea to have musicians post ideas and have other artists add tracks to the original idea.
A musician can register as a creator, a cocreator, or both.
In the future would like to have a version where the creator accounts and co creators accounts can be linked, or just be the same, but i ran into problems with
primary/foreign key conflicts.
Next step is to actually have audio files, or links to audio files in the database, and be able to preview them.
