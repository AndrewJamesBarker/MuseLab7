# MuseLab7

Hello, My name is Andrew Barker, and this is MuseLab, a musicians collaborative application.

The idea is to have musicians post ideas and have other artists add tracks to the original idea.
A musician can register as a creator, a cocreator, or both.
In the future I would like to have a version where the creator accounts and co creators accounts can be linked, or just be the same, but I ran into problems with primary/foreign key conflicts.

The next step is to actually have audio files, or links to audio files in the database, and be able to preview them.
