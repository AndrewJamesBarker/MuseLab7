# MuseLab7

Hello, My name is Andrew Barker, and this is MuseLab, a musicians' collaborative application.

The idea is to have musicians post ideas and have other artists add tracks to the original idea.
A musician can register as a creator, a cocreator, or both.
In the future, I would like a version where the creator and co-creators' accounts can be linked or just be the same, but I ran into problems with primary/foreign key conflicts.
The next step is to have audio files or links to audio files in the database and be able to preview them.
